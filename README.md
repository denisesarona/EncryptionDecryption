# Simple Encryption and Decryption System

## Overview

This project is a Simple Encryption and Decryption System that implements three different algorithms: Caesar cipher, XOR encryption, and RSA encryption. The system allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using these methods, providing a basic understanding of cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts letters in the plaintext by a specified number.
- **XOR Encryption**: Uses the XOR bitwise operation for encryption.
- **RSA Encryption**: Uses prime number properties for asymmetric encryption.
- **Combined Encryption**: Sequentially applies Caesar, XOR, and RSA encryption for enhanced security.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Dev C++ (or any compatible C++ IDE)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Dev C++ (or any compatible C++ IDE)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denisesaronae/EncryptionDecryption.git
   cd EncryptionDecryption
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Dev C++**

   - Launch Dev C++.
   - Open the project file.

3. **Build and Run**

   - Select Execute -> Compile & Run in the menu.

## Usage

1. Run the application
2. Enter plaintext, Caesar shift value, and XOR key.
3. The application will display the encrypted and decrypted messages using the combined encryption method.
